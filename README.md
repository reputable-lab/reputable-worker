## Services

### Data-Warehouse Service

The Data-Warehouse Service is responsible for creating and seeding the database. It ensures that the necessary structure is in place and populates initial data, providing a foundational setup for other services.

### API Service

The API Service provides access to the data stored in the Prisma database managed by the Data-Warehouse Service. It acts as a gateway for retrieving information from the database, enabling seamless integration and interaction with the stored data.

### Data Collection Services

These services are dedicated to collecting and enriching data for the database:

- Off-Chain Service: Gathers data about developers from off-chain sources, primarily focusing on GitHub profiles and related information.

- On-Chain Service: Collects on-chain data pertaining to smart contracts developed within the ecosystem.

- Reputation Model Service: Utilizes the accumulated off-chain and on-chain data to calculate and assign a reputation score to developers. This score serves as a quantitative measure based on their contributions and activities.
